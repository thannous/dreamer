# Mock Mode Environment Variables
# This file enables mock/development mode where all API calls and services are simulated
# To use: npm run start:mock (or manually copy this to .env.local)

# Enable mock mode - this is the key flag that switches all services to mock implementations
EXPO_PUBLIC_MOCK_MODE=true

# Mock mode doesn't require real API credentials, but you can keep these for reference
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL is ignored in mock mode
# EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are also not used

# Note: When mock mode is enabled, the app will:
# - Use simulated API responses with realistic delays (1-5 seconds)
# - Pre-load 8 predefined dreams into storage
# - Use in-memory storage (changes persist during app session only)
# - Log all service calls to console for debugging
# - Mock notification scheduling (logs to console only)
# - Use placeholder images from picsum.photos

# To return to normal mode: npm run start:real
